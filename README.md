# UFOs

## Overview of Project

The intent of this project is to take a data source containing various details regarding UFO sightings and provide users the ability to filter through the entire data source across the variables to get the specific content that they would want to view.

## Resources

* Data Source: Data.js

* Software: Javascript, HTML

## Results


### How the Search Criteria Can by Utilized!

* Building in the Filter Search criteria allows the user to filter based on Date, City, State, Country or Shape
* This will allow for easier viewing of the data, so the user can view only what they want to look at, at any one time
* Instead of the user having to manually go through the list, this allows for the filters to be combined and easily view only a summarized view of the information
* As shown below is an example of utilizing a specific date (1/10/2010) and state (ca) that is wanted to be viewed

## UFO Search Summary

One drawback of this new design is that if too many filters are applied it can easily return no data to the user and therefore could cause the user to have to run multiple searches.

Two additional recommendations that could be performed would be the following:

1. Order the data in a certain method or allow for sorting feature by column so the user can more easily few the data and then apply the filters.
2. Create drop down options for the filters so the user knows what options are available as it is not currently clear without going through the data to understand the various options and combinations.
